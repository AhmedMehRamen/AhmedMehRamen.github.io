	<h2>For The Sake Of This Assignment</h2>
	<p> Hello!! My name is Ahmed Rahman and I am a student at Bronx early college academy. This website will be my first website that I created. It will be about me and what I like or want to do. Additionally this website will show my ability to do html. <p>
   
   <br>

   <h2><em> Interests </em> </h2>
   <p> I have many interests. Forexample I like sports such as basketball, soccer, and cricket. Aditionally I like to hang out with friends or travel and go on different adventures, however due to the recent pandemic that has been difficult to do. Last but not least I like to watch anime and shows on my spare time. </p>

   <br>

   <h2><em> Career Goals </em></h2>
   <p> To be honest I haven’t decided yet what I want to do, but I have some options in mind. I would like to pursue a career in<strong> mechanical engineering</strong> or<strong> buisness</strong>. I don’t know what specific careers I want to pursue but anything thats related to the options I stated.</p>

   <br>

   <h2><em> Future plans</em></h2> 
   <p> Currently my plan is to go to college and get my bachelors. Then pursue a career and get established hopefully in New York City because this is where I grew up. I would like to achieve success in the career that I pursue, and I would like to travel the world on my vacations. Also I plan to help people in need as much as I can and support my community. </p>
